Summary:
 I created a Flashcard page which has many forms. One is for create group and add description in which user type group name and add about something in description. Formik  we used for validation purpose.
Another form is for enter term and enter definition. This page is dynimacaly in which I use edit and delete functionality. We also give add more button for create more terms for user want. We also do validation for using a formic also.
In this we also have MyFlashcard page which shows the detail of users flashcards like group name, desc, terms and definition. Name and desc show on top and all terms show no left side of app. On the right side show the share, download, and print button. If we click on share button the url is shown and we copied them.
And the entire data of user write here go to the localstorage.
